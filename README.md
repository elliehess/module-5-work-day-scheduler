## Usage

When you open the daily planner, you will see the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When you scroll down, you will be presented with time blocks for standard business hours. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. 
To enter an event, click on a time block, type the scheduled event and then click the save button for that time block. The text for that event will be saved in local storage. When you refresh the page, the saved events will persist in your schedule.
